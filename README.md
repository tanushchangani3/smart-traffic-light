## Description
A solar-powered smart traffic light system that aims to revolutionize conventional traffic lights. The smart system intelligently adjusts light timings based on real-time traffic conditions, significantly reducing energy usage and resulting in substantial cost savings and contributing to a greener environment by reducing carbon emissions. The project leverages Arduino and IoT technologies, along with an array of sensors such as temperature, pressure, RFID, ultrasonic, image, and OLED displays. It optimizes traffic flow and ensures efficient transportation networks by utilizing real-time traffic data and intelligent features. The project includes a website that collects and analyses data. This website provides real-time traffic information, records violations captured by cameras, and offers insights for monitoring and decision-making.
